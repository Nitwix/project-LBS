Project Learn By Sorting

## Aim and applications
The aim of this Flutter app is to help people learn to generalize concepts by sorting items into categories.
The idea was given by my father who teaches communication methods to severly handicaped people and people on the autistic spectrum.
He is convinced that a key to generalizing concepts is being able to sort items, first very concrete (apple, pear, avocado)
and maybe later more abstract (the object is *above*, the object is *between*, the object is *under*).

Other applications may include teaching for children (associating pictures of objects with their textual representation (aka name)).

## Contributions
At the moment, the project is in its very early stages, and I'm still figuring out how flutter works (but for now I'm pleasently surprised).
So code contributions are not useful for now.
**However**, I would be very happy to receive constructive criticism, either on my code (as ÃŒ'm not really familiar with Flutter or Dart, I may do some unusual things) or on the general idea of the project.
I also welcome all ideas for future features of the app.

## Installing
1. If Flutter is not yet installed, install it by following https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. Clone the repo and open it in the editor you configured.
3. For now, there's not much to see, but if you want to see anything, you'll need to put some images in assets/fruits/images and rename them as in assets/fruits/metadata.json file (this is very temporary, I plan to make a .lbs file format that encapsulates the images and the metadata.json to be able to open arbitrary datasets in the app).
